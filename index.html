                    <p>Hi, my name is Hyrum. I'm 17, and I live in Alberta, Canada, for now. My family and I like to travel a lot around the world. We have been to Dubai and to volcanoes, etc. Uh, what else about me? Oh yeah, I like programming. That is really fun. I started on Scratch when I was a kid, but now I'm gradually going on Unity. I also do pixel art on Aseprite. Though I would not call myself an expert, I make good art. One of the cool things about me, is I have amazing friends worldwide! We go to some unique places every year, and travelling has become a big part of our family. I have four brothers; one is older than me and has left on his mission, and the three younger ones ranging from ages 14 to 10 are just chilling with me. Some things I like to do are D&D, Minecraft, RainWorld/SlugCat/Gourmand, reading the Book of Mormon (you should read this book; it's really good XD), and hanging out with my friends.</p>

                    <h1>Alberta</h1>
                    <img src="images/alberta.jpg" alt="Alberta Sign">
                    <p>Alberta is a province in Western Canada. Its landscape encompasses mountains, prairies, desert badlands and vast coniferous forests. It has more than 600 lakes, and rich mineral deposits. In the west, the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks have glaciers in the Columbia Icefields. The Waterton Glacier International Peace Park is a biosphere reserve that straddles the southern border with the USA.</p>
